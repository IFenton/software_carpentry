Hiawatha
========

Should you ask me whence these stories?
Whence these legends and traditions?
With the dew and damp of meadows?
With the curling smoke of wigwams?
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you
