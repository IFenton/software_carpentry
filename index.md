Hiawatha
========

Should you ask me whence these stories?
Whence these legends and traditions?
With the dew and damp of meadows?
With the curling smoke of wigwams?

Daffodils
=========

I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills
And all at once I saw a crowd 
A host of golden daffodils

If
==

If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you.
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
Yet make allowance for their doubting too.
