Hiawatha
========

Should you ask me whence these stories?
Whence these legends and traditions?
With the dew and damp of meadows?
With the curling smoke of wigwams?
With the rushing of great rivers 
With their frequent repetitions
And their wild reverberations
As of thunder in the mountains.

Daffodils
=========

I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills
And all at once I saw a crowd 
A host of golden daffodils
Beside the lake, beneath the trees
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze

If
==

If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you.
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
Yet make allowance for their doubting too.
If you can wait and not be tired of waiting
Or being lied about don't deal in lies
Or being hated don't give way to hating
And yet don't look too good or talk to wise
